### Description
This library is created keeping those developers in mind who wish to automate their website for a task but do not wish to spend an excessive amount of time learning a new library.We made every effort when creating this toolkit to make web automation as simple and efficient as possible. This library's backend is the Python client for Selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/). Selenium is the standard library for web automation and is quite powerful.

In order to make things simple and easy to understand for anyone with a background in selenium, we have made an effort to keep the function name as close to the original selenium functions as possible.

### Advantage
This library has below advantages when compared with others
  1. Saves a tonne of time by preventing us from writing repetitive code because it is simple to setup and use.
  2. There is no need to configure anything because it supports the Chrome browser out of the box; internally, everything is taken care of.
  3. Prior to taking any action, it by default highlights the weblement (the target web element on which you wish to conduct some operations).
  4. It makes things simpler for the user by using XPATH by default for the locator strategy.
  5. Finally, although it is a plug-and-play library built on top of Selenium, you still get the power of Selenium when using it.
