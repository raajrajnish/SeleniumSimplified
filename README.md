# SeleniumSimplified
a free, open-source web automation library for the Chrome browser using Selenium Python.

### Description
This library is created keeping those developers in mind who wish to automate their website for a task but do not wish to spend an excessive amount of time learning a new library.We made every effort when creating this toolkit to make web automation as simple and efficient as possible. This library's backend is the Python client for Selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/). Selenium is the standard library for web automation and is quite powerful.

In order to make things simple and easy to understand for anyone with a background in selenium, we have made an effort to keep the function name as close to the original selenium functions as possible.
